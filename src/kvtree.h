/** \defgroup kvtree KVTree
 *  \brief KVTree is the core data structure of all of the components.
 *
 * Each KVTree object contains a list of key/value pairs. Each key is a string,
 * each value is another kvtree object. This is a nested data structures,
 * similar to a python dict or perl hash. The library provides functions to
 * serialize a kvtree object to / from a file. It also optionally provides MPI
 * send / recv functions to transfer an object from one process to another.
 *
 * In addition to getter and setter utilities, this library provides
 * serialization (for persisting an KVTree to a file) and optional MPI
 * functionality.
